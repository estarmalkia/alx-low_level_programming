C - More pointers, arrays and strings
What is array of pointers to string?
An array of pointers to strings is an array of character pointers where each pointer points to the first character of the string or the base address of the string.
What is array of strings in C?
Strings in C. Strings are defined as an array of characters. The difference between a character array and a string is the string is terminated with a special character '\0'. Declaration of strings: Declaring a string is as simple as declaring a one dimensional array.
What does %P mean C?
Functions belonging to the printf function family have the type specifiers "%p" and "%x". "p" serves to output a pointer. It may differ depending upon the compiler and platform. "x" and "X" serve to output a hexadecimal number. "x" stands for lower case letters (abcdef) while "X" for capital letters (ABCDEF).
Is an array a pointer C?
An array is a collection of secuential and contiguous elements in memory. In C an array's name is the index to the first element, and applying an offset you can access the rest of elements. An "index to the first element" is indeed a pointer to a memory direction. Array name is the address of 1st element of an array.
What are the advantages of using array of pointers to string instead of an array of strings?
String Sorting: String sorting would be fast when you have pointers because you now just have tp change the starting address instead of whole array.
...
Advantages of Pointer over Array:

    Allows you to implement sharing without copying, i.e., pass by reference. ...
    Pointers allow to use dynamic memory allocation.
What is pointer to string in C?
A C string is nothing but an array of characters, so a pointer to a string is a pointer to an array of characters. And a pointer to an array is the very same as a pointer to its first element. The string is basically bounded from the place where it is pointed to ( char *ptrChar; ), to the null character ( \0 ).
What is a array in C?
Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type. ... All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations.
